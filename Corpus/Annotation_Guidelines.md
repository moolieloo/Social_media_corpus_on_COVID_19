Annotation Guidelines and Materials
================

#### Task Overview

Social media posts about the coronavirus were collected from Weibo and
Twitter. The annotation task is to identify the intent of post from the
original poster (OP). We identified six major categories that describe
the intent of the post:

1.  *advice* - any guidance or recommendations offered by OP.
2.  *marketing* - promotion, advertisement or sales of a business or
    product.
3.  *personal opinion* - any comments that express OP’s thoughts and
    feelings.
4.  *inform* - the sharing of facts like information from news sources.
5.  *crowdsourcing* - questions posed to the public.
6.  *other/unsure* - when the post does not fall under any of the above
    categories.

Only one choice can be made per post. Some posts can be interpreted to
have multiple intents. In these cases, choose the most likely category
or what you feel is the strongest intent. We will provide more
guidelines and examples in the next section. If the decision is still
unclear, choose the *other/unsure* category as a last resort.

#### Annotation Labels with Examples

**1. *advice***

Given our topic, a lot of people are sharing how to stay safe and
healthy. A couple of typical examples are:

> Take care of yourself Protect yourself from virus.

> Be Safe from \#coronavirus infection

> 特殊时期，大家一定要戴好口罩，勤洗手，注意个人卫生，众志成城、渡过难关。

A source of confusion may be when OP posts recommendations from a
third-party. In this case, please select *inform* since OP is directly
referencing the source of the advice. For example:

> To prepare for a scenario where Americans are asked to shelter in
> place due to \#coronavirus, RAND’s Lori Uscher-Pines recommends
> stocking up on a two-week supply of food. Here’s her advice in
> @foodandwine: <https://t.co/b0Ms1Aoad0>

In the following example, the categories *advice* and *inform* are both
present in the post. Please select the category based on what most of
the post is about. In this case, the right choice is *inform* since only
the last line, “Avoid mass gathering.”, is *advice*. The example:

> In view of \#Coronavirus outbreak, Hon’ble PM Modi ji & top party
> functionaries will skip \#Holi celebrations. The Rashtrapati Bhavan
> will also not hold the Holi gatherings as experts have advised to
> reduce mass gatherings to avoid spread of \#COVID19. Avoid mass
> gathering. <https://t.co/yjOMP7Zieq>


**2. *marketing***

An obvious sign of marketing is the presence of words like “click here
for more information”. The following are typical examples:

> Tune in to the @CDCgov webinar on March 5 at 2pm EST on what
> clinicians need to know to prepare for the \#coronavirus in the United
> States. For more information click here: <https://t.co/yxTUN8Pmp8>.

> Will your \#mediclaim cover treatment of \#coronavirus? Do travel
> policies cover flight cancellations due to \#COVID19? Do you have
> global \#healthinsurance? All the answers on a special edition of
> \#Money Money Money 7:30 pm @SurabhiUpadhyay @rau\_anup
> @Future\_Generali @bajajsanjiv <https://t.co/32PqkzzHhD>

> 叮！请注意！第一版医护抗疫表情包在武汉江汉开发区方舱医院正式推出啦！“真棒”“奥利给”“戴口罩”……武汉江汉开发区方舱医院专属版权，抗疫医护表情包1.0版静
> 图、 动图表情包，让沟通充满正能量！网页链接

In the next example, the categories *inform* and *marketing* are both
valid choices. This post’s content is pretty evenly split between the
two categories (i.e., first sentence is *inform* and second is
*marketing*). In this case, please select *inform* because, in a way,
*marketing* a news source can be considered informing the public of
news.

> Delhi government advises its offices to suspend biometric attendance
> over \#coronavirus Get the latest updates on the \#Covid19 global
> outbreak here: <https://t.co/tkvgg4tEwA> <https://t.co/R3WFra3SUP>

**3. *personal opinion***

Any posts that reveal OP’s mindset falls under this category, even if
facts/news (i.e., *inform*) are mentioned. A couple of typical examples:

> This is the most scary thing \#coronavirus \#coronavirusinindia
> <https://t.co/nGpebPSpct>

> So far what is unique to Iran is the spread of Coronavirus among the
> first rank leadership. Which is worth investigating more. An example
> of how targeted biological warfare could work if ever implemented.
> \#coronavirus \#COVIDー19 \#Iran \#Pandemics

> 出门前戴好口罩瑟瑟发抖，上车后安全感满满，为自我消毒、安装防护膜的司机比心。
> 疫情过后撸串火锅约起，武汉加油！ 百花香帅的微博视频 

A point of confusion may be between *personal opinion* and
*crowdsourcing*. Sometimes opinions are expressed as questions, perhaps
in sarcasm. In this case, select *personal opinion* since OP is not
actually soliciting the public for feedback. For example:

> Hmm there’s a shortage of laptops now? \#coronavirus

**4. *inform***

The definition of this category is the dissemination of facts and news
without personal opinions. A common example is to directly reference
news sources like in the following example:

> Canadian health officials warn schools of potentially critical role in
> slowing \#coronavirus spread: Globe and Mail <https://t.co/8B6Rx08jSV>
> MORE w/ EcoSearch - news: <https://t.co/qfAx9oqYzF> web:
> <https://t.co/9iMsc5cMpf>

> 近日，萝北县公安局刑警大队破获了1起涉疫情电信诈骗案件。
> 嫌疑人在网络上卖口罩，诈骗4人，诈骗金额达48万。嫌疑人实施诈骗后，
> 看见宣传标语迫于压力，携款自首。

Titles of media articles written as if it is text can be tricky to spot.
The following examples should be *inform* and not *personal opinion* or
*crowdsourcing*:

> I’m an emergency doctor. I expect to get coronavirus (opinion) - CNN
> <https://t.co/ItPgaqWjw0> \#COVID19 \#ERDoctor \#Coronavirus \#ER
> \#Doctors \#snrtg

> Can We Overcome A Real Pandemic? \#News \#bloomberg \#pandemic
> \#coronavirus \#disease \#animals \#health \#medicine \#black death
> \#SARS \#plag <https://t.co/nXDeWzwHui>

**5. *crowdsourcing***

When OP seeks the public for feedback, this is considered crowdsourcing.
Examples:

> Should you get travel insurance amid \#Coronavirus concerns?
> <https://t.co/KBlPwlJAvR>

> Who else is sick of all the \#coronavirus nonsense?

**6. *other/unsure***

Weibo and Twitter both contain links to images and videos. When a post
is a direct reference to data that cannot be interpreted by text alone,
then *other/unsure* is the correct choice since there is simply not
enough information for the intent of the post to come across. For
example:

> \#Coronavirus effects <https://t.co/VJt9CD8vJo>

> Regular daily morning pickups… \#coronavirus <https://t.co/coWBPhsbjL>
> 02 \#WednsdayWisdom

For posts with ambiguous or overlapping categories, please select
*other/unsure* as a last resort when you are truly in doubt.
