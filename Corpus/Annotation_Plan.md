Annotation Plan
================

#### Annotation Overview

Weibo posts in Chinese and Twitter posts in English make up our corpus.
The annotation will be categorizing the intent of the post from the
original poster (OP) into one of six categories:

1.  *advice* - any guidance or recommendations offered by OP (e.g.,
    “Remember to wear masks.”).
2.  *marketing* - promoting a business or product (e.g., “Buy
    coronavirus insurance\!”).
3.  *personal opinion* - any comments that expresses how OP feels (e.g.,
    “Look what the outbreak has done to my travel plans\!”).
4.  *inform* - sharing of facts like information from the news (e.g.,
    “Washington also announced another death.”).
5.  *crowdsourcing* - asking the public for information (e.g., “What do
    you think about covid-19?”)
6.  *other/unsure*

Please see “Annotation Guidelines and Materials” for more details.

#### Tools

We will provide our annotators two csv\_files, one for each source. In
each file, there will be an “annotation” column. In each cell, there is
a drop down menu with the six categories identified above. Only one
category can be selected. The drop-down menus is created using the
built-in validity tool.

#### Annotators

Rannie Lin and Jon Chan will be our annotators. They are bilingual –
native speakers of Chinese and fluent in English.

#### Annotator Training

We will train our annotators by:

  - Thoroughly explaining the different annotation categories.
  - Providing clear guidelines in choosing a category when there is
    ambiguity.
  - Going through sample posts where there is ambiguity or overlap in
    categories.
  - Conducting a practice run with annotators by reviewing the first 50
    annotations to ensure strong interannotator agreement.

#### Rough Expectation

Our annotators have agreed to commit three hours to annotating our
corpus, dividing the time evenly between the two sources. We expect
approximately 25 annotations to be completed in 5 minutes. Based on this
estimate, by the next Milestone we should have a total of 900
annotations, 450 for Weibo and 450 for Twitter.

#### Annotation Code Explanation

There is no annotation code because we are using the csv tool, validity,
to create the drop-down menu for annotators to use.
